# There are many specialist uses for erosion. One of the more common is to separate touching objects in a binary image so that they can be counted using a labeling algorithm.

 It is required to count the coins. However, this is not going to be easy since the touching coins form a single fused region of white, and a counting algorithm would have to first segment this region into separate coins before counting, a non-trivial task. The situation can be much simplified by eroding the image. The image
